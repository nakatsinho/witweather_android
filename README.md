# Witweather_android

This is a challenge assigned by Wit, which aimed to build an Android App to visualize the temperature in my current location, in this case (Maputo - MOZ) and in some suggested European cities (Lisbon, Madrid, Paris, Berlin, Copenhagen , Rome, London, Dublin, Prague and Vienna).

For the sake of distraction, I will have initially created the App in Flutter (Dart Language) and then migrated to Native Android (with Kotlin), as soon as I realized the request.

I was assigned the link (http://openweathermap.org/api), so that I could consume the data brought by the same API -> OPEN WEATHER MAP.

Below I present the built interface: 
<div style="display: inline_block">
